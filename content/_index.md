# Parenting Workshops for Todayâ€™s World

Parents and Company was created to bring small groups of parents together in a friendly, confidential, atmosphere to share parenting experiences and learn together. We designed our parenting workshops to be safe spaces where you can feel heard and understood. By getting to know other parents, along with experts such as psychologists, psychiatrists and therapists, you will learn strategies to help your kids navigate the challenges that children and teens are dealing with today.
